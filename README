================

Tabletop Traders is based on "The Settlers of Catan" by Klaus Teuber.

Tabletop Traders was inspired by Pioneers (http://pio.sourceforge.net/),
but is an independent implementation designed for table-top (surface)
computers. It may be usable on some larger touchpads but is unlkely to ever
be playable on phones or desktop/laptop computers. Tabletop Traders is
built on the kivy framework (https://github.com/kivy/kivy).



Status
======

The game is currently in development. See the "ROADMAP.org" file for a
detailed list of current and planned features.
